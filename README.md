# NeMig
NeMig represents a bilingual news collection and knowledge graphs on the topic of migration. The news corpora in German and English were collected from online media outlets from Germany and the US, respectively. NeMIg contains rich textual and metadata information, sentiment and political orientation annotations, as well as named entities extracted from the articles' content and metadata and linked to Wikidata. The corresponding knowledge graphs (NeMigKG) built from each corpus are expanded with up to two-hop neighbors from Wikidata of the initial set of linked entities.

## Features
NeMigKG comes in four flavors, for both the German, and the English corpora:

- **Base NeMigKG**: contains literals and entities from the corresponding annotated news corpus;
- **Entities NeMigKG**: derived from the Base NeMIg by removing all literal nodes, it contains only resource nodes;
- **Enriched Entities NeMigKG**: derived from the Entities NeMig by enriching it with up to two-hop neighbors from Wikidata, it contains only resource nodes and Wikidata triples;
- **Complete NeMigKG**: the combination of the Base and Enriched Entities NeMig, it contains both literals and resources.

## How to run

Install dependencies

```bash
# clone project
git clone https://github.com/andreeaiana/nemig
cd nemig

# [OPTIONAL] create conda environment
conda create -n nemig_env python=3.9
conda activate nemig_env

# install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Download the mGENRE model as described in [mGENRE](https://github.com/facebookresearch/GENRE/tree/main/examples_mgenre) needed for running the entity linking model.


Run pipeline with chosen experiment configuration from [configs/experiment/](configs/experiment/)

```bash
python main.py experiment=experiment_name.yaml
```

You can override any parameter from command line like this

```bash
python src/main.py language='de' kg_construction.k_hop=1
```

Run the [Subtopic Modelling notebook](notebooks/1.0-subtopic-modeling-en.ipynb) to extract sub-topics from the data and integrate the results in the pipeline.

The chosen version of NeMig will be constructed and cached in the [cache folder](data/cache/). NeMigKG is serialized in N-Triple format, and the resulting files are placed in the [kg folder](data/kg/).

## Data
A sample of the annotated news corpora used to construct the knowledge graphs are available in the [cache folder](data/cache). Due to copyright policies, this sample does not contain the body of the articles. A full version of the news corpus is available [upon request](mailto:andreea.iana@uni-mannheim.de).

The anonymized user data for each dataset is available in the [user data folder](data/user_data/).

## KG Triples
[NeMigKG](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7442424) is hosted on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/). All files are [gzipped](https://www.gzip.org/) and in [N-Triples format](https://www.w3.org/TR/n-triples/). 

A sample of the triple files for can be found in the [kg folder](data/kg/). Due to copyright policies, these samples do not contain the body of the news articles.
